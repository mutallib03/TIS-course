| 1 | Assignment 1/Poster | Reflection 1 <br> The speaker who had my full attention and growing enthusiasm to hit the ground running was Mr. Yee. The way he spoke and his enthusiasm made me think of something different, especially when he told me about his wealth of experience and how he managed to reach such a powerful position. He has a big heart. It helps us achieve what we have achieved as quickly as possible and with the least amount of effort. I also learned from this meeting that if you do not start self-learning early, you will face difficulties later. |

| 3 | Assignment 3/Report | Reflection 3 <br> Sometime recently this discourse, the term "analytics" was new to me, and I had never found myself charmed by it. In any case, taking after this shrewd industry discourse, my interest has been provoked, and I discover myself drawn to investigating a potential career way in analyticsâ€”a prospect I hadn't considered for some time recently. I appreciate the opportunity given by the scholarly environment at Institution talk, which permits understudies like me to pick up presentations to real-world working flow, indeed within the early stages of our scholarly travel. This presentation has not as it were broadened my understanding but has too opened up unused conceivable outcomes and career roads that I might not have something else found. I am thankful for the profitable bits of knowledge and points of view shared, forming my desires and fostering a honest to goodness intrigue within the field of analytics.  |
